## Process

- `node index.js`:

1. Process and execute code in index.js file.
2. Do we still have work to do? Look at timers, OS tasks, threadpool.
3. If step 2 is no, then Exit the program.
4. Run setTimout's, setInterval's.
5. Run callbacks for any os tasks or threadpool tasks that are done. (This is 99% of our code.)
