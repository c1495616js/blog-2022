## Hooks flow

Understanding the flow is very important. Especailly for `useEffect`.
At `Update` phrase, will run `cleanup effect` from the last time return.
And the `Run Effects`` phase is executed last.

- Notice that `Mount` will not run `cleanup effects`.
- Notice that `Unmount` only runs `cleanup effects`.

Here is a code example that explains this flow:

```tsx
export const MyComponent: FC = () => {
  // 1. Run Lazy initializers (i.e. () => 0)
  const [state, setState] = useState(() => 0);

  const previousStateRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    // 3. Run effect
    previousStateRef.current = state;
  }); // no deps array, because we want this to be called on every render

  // 2. Render
  return (
    <>
      Prev: {previousStateRef.current ?? 'undefined'}
      <br />
      Current: {state}
      <br />
      <button onClick={() => setState(1)}>Update</button>
    </>
  );
};
```
