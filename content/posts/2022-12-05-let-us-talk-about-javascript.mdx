Let's learn JS from the very beginning as it's very important to have a great foundation.

## Day 1 - JS Engine

### Outline

- JS script -- JS Engine --> Machine codes.
- JS engine optimization

### Why we need JS Engine

Because JS is the advanced programming language, it could be executed by computer directly.
Therefore, it needs to transform the machine code via JS engine.

Then, where is the JS Engine? Answer: `inside of The Browser`.
Ex: V8 of Google Chrome, JavaScriptCore of Safari and SpiderMonkey of Firefox.

And now most JS engines combine both the JIT Compiler(Just in-time compiler) of Interpreter and Compilier.

### The Process of V8 engine.

1. A module `Parser` of V8 will parse the JS syntax to `AST`.
